Description: Protein-level summarization of feature (PSM)-level data is an important step
    in proteomics data analysis methods, including the MSstats workflow. MSstats and MSstatsTMT
    packages summarize features based on unique peptides. This package provides implements 
    a statistical method to jointly summarize clusters of proteins that share features 
    using weights specific to peptide-protein matches.
